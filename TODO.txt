TODO list

Near-term Issues:
- Fix Tenpai mode in ScoreScreen to display proper Waits
- Ability to zoom-in on pictures
- Ensure flowchart is high enough quality for horizontal mode
- Update Flowchart to include Fu scoring steps
- Test app with different "Android Accessibility: TextSize" settings


Known Issues:
- Locking screen during quiz breaks timer


Long-term Issues:
- Ability to change font text size and/or zoom-in
- Add a HandCalculator clarifying step, should there be an ambiguous closed kan (very rare)
- Add glossary (that can be used throughout app)
- Add Tutorial mode to Rules section (skipping over complicating details, such as determining seats/dealer/drawing order/etc)
- Shanten calculations are imprecise
