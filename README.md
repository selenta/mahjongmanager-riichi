A companion Android app for Riichi Mahjong to help players of all skill levels learn how to score hands and improve their speed/accuracy. Consists of several tables and tools to examine the scoring process from different perspectives and skill levels. The information provided in this app assumes that the user will at least know the basic game flow (i.e. the number of tiles in a hand, that a hand must have a yaku to win, how calling works, etc.), and is designed to help them get to the point that they can announce a win and know the point value of their hand.

For beginners, there are explanations on the scoring process and how to determine the Han/Fu in a hand. In addition to the definition of the different yaku, there is some other contextual information, such as the relative frequency of each yaku in actual winning hand to illustrate that although the list is long, not all yaku are equally important to know when first learning.
For intermediate players, there is a hand keyboard where you can enter a hand as well as all of the circumstantial information (i.e. enter the tiles in the hand, specify the winning tile, was the winning tile self-drawn, etc) and the app will explain what Han/Fu are present in the hand and thus the resulting value of the hand. There are also,  tables/calculator to determine the value of a hand assuming the Han/Fu are known. 
For advanced players, the app includes a speed quiz that allows the user to test themselves, and upon completing the quiz the user can review any incorrect answers with a detailed score breakdown. There are also a few options to alter/increase the difficulty of the quiz.



This is my first Android app, and I've had a lot of fun building it from scratch. I'd like to get it up on Google Play at some point, though there are a few things that would need to happen first. Please let me know what you think! I'm always open to feedback & suggestions so feel free to send them to selentian@gmail.com
