# mahjongmanager-riichi

Designed to help players of all skill levels learn how to score hands and practice their skills.

Learning the basic game-play for Riichi Mahjong only takes a few minutes, as the game flows similarly to many popular card games. However, getting acclimated to the terminology and learning how to score hands takes a little more time and practice.

There are several tools, tables, and descriptions to help players approach and learn scoring from different perspectives. Hopefully exploring the app will allow players to find the kinds of tools that work best for them. Riichi Mahjong Manager does not include any kind of full-game simulator, as there are several other apps that are worth checking out if you wish to play. It is a simple and clean reference tool with a few minigames.

Veteran players will most likely be interested in the Speed Quiz mini-game, where players have 90 seconds to score as many hands as possible, and any incorrect answers can be reviewed. There are several options available to change the types of hands presented.

Beginner and Intermediate players will likely be interested in tools such as the Hand Calculator, where players can enter a winning hand and the app will break down the han/fu for the hand, and can click on any of the entries for a more detailed on related rules.

This is my first Android app, and I've had a lot of fun building it from scratch. Please let me know what you think! I'm always open to feedback & suggestions so feel free to send them to mahjong.manager@gmail.com
